Frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind)

Run locally (dev):

1) Install dependencies

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
```

2) Start dev server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This is a scaffold; add UI pages and integrate with /api endpoints.
- Use axios to communicate with backend (localhost:4000 by default).
